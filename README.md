## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: Designed for ease of use, the SDK simplifies interactions with the Swarms API.
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Create and manage multiple agents working collaboratively.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation helps you get started quickly.
- **Robust Performance**: Built for production use, ensuring reliability and efficiency.
- **Extensible**: Easily extend the functionality to meet your needs.

## Installation

To install the Swarms SDK, you can use pip. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install swarms-sdk
```

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can verify your Python version with:

```bash
python --version
```

## Getting Started

After installation, you can start using the SDK. Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started:

```python
from swarms_sdk import Swarm

# Create a new swarm
my_swarm = Swarm(name="My First Swarm")

# Add agents to the swarm
my_swarm.add_agent(agent_id="agent_1")
my_swarm.add_agent(agent_id="agent_2")

# Start the swarm
my_swarm.start()
```

This example shows how to create a swarm and add agents to it. You can customize the agents and their behaviors according to your requirements.

## Usage

The SDK provides several functions to interact with the Swarms API. Here are some common operations:

### Creating a Swarm

To create a new swarm, use the `Swarm` class. You can specify various parameters like name, type, and initial state.

```python
swarm = Swarm(name="Example Swarm", swarm_type="cooperative")
```

### Adding Agents

You can add agents to your swarm using the `add_agent` method. Each agent can have its own unique ID and parameters.

```python
swarm.add_agent(agent_id="agent_1", params={"role": "leader"})
swarm.add_agent(agent_id="agent_2", params={"role": "follower"})
```

### Starting the Swarm

To start the swarm, simply call the `start` method.

```python
swarm.start()
```

### Monitoring Swarm Behavior

You can monitor the swarm's performance and behavior through various methods. Use `get_status` to check the current state of the swarm.

```python
status = swarm.get_status()
print(status)
```

### Stopping the Swarm

When you are done, you can stop the swarm using the `stop` method.

```python
swarm.stop()
```
